# Global Subscription

This option uses a different strategy for subscribing to tag change events than is utilized in previous versions of
Hydra-MQTT. If numerous warnings and errors related to subscriptions appear in the logs, try this option as an
alternative. If possible, please provide feedback on whether this option works better or worse than the default
behavior, and in what specific ways it works better or worse.
